      "message": "I didn\u0027t exactly copy and past everything from DcaeServiceTypesApi; It\u0027s based off DcaeServiceTypesApi but it\u0027s a reduced/simplified version; We don\u0027t have to support everything DcaeServiceTypesApi supports and I think we should keep the 2 classes separate. Though right now, the service health check is similar to DcaeServiceTypesApi\u0027s check for the DB (without support for other api methods); later on as we use this new service health check, we might update it and make it perhaps simpler as we get more experience with it. If you still feel, it should be based off DcaeServiceTypesApi, I\u0027ll make the change.",
